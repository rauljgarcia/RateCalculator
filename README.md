# Rate Calculator
This is a simple rate calculator written in c++, to be used for determining
the proportional cost breakdowns between two or more parties sharing all fees in a 
photo shoot. 

Will include options for both equal and unequal splits.

Implemented in C++ to determine necessary logic/architecture, then to transition
to a frontend framework still TBD.
