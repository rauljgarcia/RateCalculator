# Rate Calculator
This is a simple rate calculator used to determining the proportional cost breakdowns 
between two or more parties sharing all fees in a photo shoot. 

Will include options for both equal and unequal splits.

Implemented in C++ to determine necessary logic/architecture, then to transition
to a frontend framework still TBD.
