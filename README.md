#Rate Calculator
This is a rate calculator written in c++, for determining proportional 
cost breakdowns between two or more parties sharing all fees in a 
photo shoot. 

Will include options for both equal and unequal splits.

Will implement in c++ to determine necessary logic/architecture, then transition
to a front end framework still TBD.
